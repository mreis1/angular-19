# Sample express + socket.io server

## Running
```
$ npm i
$ npm start:w
```

# Testing

- Open postman.
- Hit `New` button > `Socket.io`

Notice that `path` was intentionally left blank which defaults to `/socket.io`.
But you can enter `/socket.io` too or a custom path if you have set `path` property upon server initialisation.
